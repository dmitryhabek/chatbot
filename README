Using the bot
---------------------------------------------------------
After installation you can chat:
-Through a static HTML page (example in /gui/plain/index.php)
-Through an AJAX enabled web page (example in /gui/jquery/index.php)
-Through the Program O API (example in /gui/xml/index.php)

For advanced botmasters and programmers, it is possible to use the Program O
API to access a chatbot from stand-alone applications through HTTP requests.
for information on how to create and/or use such a stand-alone application.

Upgrade
---------------------------------------------------------
Upgrading from version 1 to version 2 is no longer supported. If you want to "upgrade"
your chatbot from version 1 to version 2, you will need to save your AIML files from the
current chatbot, perform a "clean install" of Program O, and then upload the AIML files
to the new installation. With the release of Program O version 2.2, the differences
in structure and functionality between version 1 and version 2 became too great to
continue supporting the transition.

Clean install
---------------------------------------------------------
Starting with version 2.0.1 and later, there is an automatic installer provided for clean
installation. Simply point your web browser to your freshly uploaded Program O directory
to run the install script. Then follow the instructions on the page. The installer is
designed to only run once.

Please note that the installer script will NOT create your database for you, nor will
it install your bot's AIML files. The database, along with the username/password used to
access it, needs to be created in advance. See the file FRESH_INSTALL_README.txt for more
information.
